# legal-nlp-classification
Scraped legal dataset, determined gaps in environmental data legislation. 
The goal of this project was to learn where states are lacking in terms of Environmental Law Subgroups
This means that, some states may have more oil and gas law than water pollution law. Or more in fishing and game law compared to smoke reduction.
Identifying these gaps can help policymakers work to adress areas where they are lacking. In this age, it's important to take action to reduce the affects in the future. 
Here are a couple of examples of the analysis result:

I also constructed a plot to analyze which states fall below a boxplot/ are outliers in quantity of policies for the different classifcations I chose.

These images display the bias that certain states have towards environmental policy.
